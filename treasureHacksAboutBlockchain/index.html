  <h1>Lets Learn About The Blockchain!</h1>
  <p id="introDescription">You've heard of the blockchain. It's everywhere. Unfortunately, almost no one truly knows how it works. This web page
  hopes to enlighten you (at least a little) on what the Blockchain is and how it works.</p>

    <p>You're busy, so the New York minute definition of a blockchain is this: it's a chain of blocks.</p>

    <p>The longer explanation begins with what the blocks are. Each blockchain contains blocks which contain
    a unique identifier within them. Each block also can contain arbitrary information within them, generally, each block
    contains transaction data from real-world purchases. Lastly, the block has a portion of data that points to another
    block. This data that points to another block "chains" the blocks together. Hence, the name "blockchain"! Simple!</p>

    <p>There is not only one copy of a given blockchain, however. Only keeping one copy makes the whole chain
    vulnerable to data manipulation. To solve this, there are many ledgers of the blockchain at different locations.
    So, each ledger checks against everyone else's ledger to make sure no invalid changes were made. A change is verified
    only when all the blockchains have the same update.</p>

    <p> I hope this humble website inspired you to learn more about the vase world of blockchains!
    Computer science has many avenues to go down. One could go their whole carer without knowing blockchains!
    It's always best to get an introductory lesson on new topics to see what inspires you! You may become
    a great blockchain developer!</p>
